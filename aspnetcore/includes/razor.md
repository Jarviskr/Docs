This tutorial teaches ASP.NET Core MVC web development with controllers and views. Razor Pages is a feature of the ASP.NET Core MVC framework introduced in ASP.NET Core 2.0. Razor Pages programming:

* Is page-based programming model that makes building web UI easier and more productive. 
* Is similar to MVC.
* Can be used with MVC controllers and views.

After using both MVC and Razor Pages, many developers prefer Razor Pages. We recommend you try the [Razor Pages](xref:tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start) tutorial before the MVC/Controller/Views version. The Razor Pages tutorial:

* Is the preferred approach for new application development.
* Is easier to follow.
* Covers more features.

If you choose this tutorial over the [Razor Pages](xref:tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start) version, let us know why in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/aspnet/Docs/issues/6146).
